	I’m happy to hear you’re doing well! That art installation sounds incredible. Please send photos of your work when you can. I hope the auction goes well.
	I’m “holding up” alright. Mom and Dad are the same as always. I’m looking forward to moving out.
	How is your personal life? Are you still with Emily?
