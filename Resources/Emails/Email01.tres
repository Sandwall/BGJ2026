I hope all is well. I discovered this address when cleaning out our room. It was wedged in the back corner, where you used to hide your illicit materials. I threw out what was left under there.
I put your old gameboy in the giveaway pile. Your sketchbook I plan to keep.
	Please let me know if there is anything else you would like me to hold on to.
Sincerely,
“Duckie”"
